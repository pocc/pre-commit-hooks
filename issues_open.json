If the errors in all files were showed in one go, they can be corrected in one go, and would avoid the user attempting to commit multiple times until all the files are eventually fixed.",

Basically clang-tidy takes all files.\r\n\r\nHow I can make the exclude pattern work for clang-tidy also?

    "body": "I noticed this issue with `ClangTidyCmd` but it it is an issue for all the other similar concrete classes (`CppcheckCmd`, `CpplintCmd`, `IncludeWhatYouUseCmd`, etc.).\r\n\r\nI am working on a cross-platform C++ repo that has windows/ and linux/ subfolders for implementations on a specific OS. I'm setting up linting. Clang-tidy, as expected, can only process the code for the current system (Linux / Windows). e.g. if I am on Linux and run your hooks with the command `pre-commit run --all-files clang-tidy`, it will try to parse the Windows files and error out.\r\n\r\nBecause pre-commit-config.yaml does not take variables, I created a shim script that filters out any files from the wrong folder. For example, if I am on Linux and pre-commit passes some file named `foo/windows/bar.cpp` in argv, the shim will create a new list without that file and call your hook. \r\n\r\n_.pre-commit-config.yaml_:\r\n```\r\nrepos:\r\n  - repo: https://github.com/pocc/pre-commit-hooks\r\n    rev: v1.3.5\r\n    hooks:\r\n      - id: clang-tidy\r\n        entry: scripts/pocc-shim.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n_scripts/pocc-shim.py_:\r\n```\r\ndef main() -> int:\r\n    \"\"\"Filter out filenames from other system implementations and call pocc's clang-tidy hook with the modified args.\"\"\"\r\n\r\n    if sys.platform == \"win32\":\r\n        exclude = \"linux\"\r\n    elif sys.platform == \"linux\":\r\n        exclude = \"windows\"\r\n    else:\r\n        raise NotImplementedError(f\"Not implemented for system: {sys.platform}\")\r\n\r\n    filtered_args = shim_utils.filter_args(exclude, sys.argv)\r\n    return hooks.clang_tidy.main(filtered_args)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**The issue is that this doesn't work. Clang-tidy is still failing on files shouldn't have been passed to it.**\r\n\r\nI had a look at _utils.py_ and saw that `Command.get_added_files` is reading directly from `sys.argv` instead of the `args` variable passed in.\r\n\r\nMy current workaround is to just set sys.argv.\r\n_scripts/pocc-shim.py_:\r\n```\r\nfiltered_args = shim_utils.filter_args(exclude, sys.argv)\r\nsys.argv = filtered_args  # set sys.argv as workaround\r\nreturn hooks.clang_tidy.main(filtered_args)\r\n```\r\nAfter this, the hook passes on both systems, properly ignoring files from the excluded folders.\r\n\r\nI find this workaround distasteful, but it works fine and is acceptable for my purposes.\r\n\r\nHowever, the underlying issue should still be addressed.\r\n\r\n### Repro\r\n\r\nYou can see my code here https://github.com/akfreed/CppSocketsXPlatform/commit/df8ac584207130e305de562e01e154407857e2ea.
